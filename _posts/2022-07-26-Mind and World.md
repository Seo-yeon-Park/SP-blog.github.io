In <I>Mind and World</I> (1994), McDowell tries to explain the relation between mind and world - very broad and difficult topic!
This book left us lots of interesting questions.

To avoid the terrible oscilation between a coherentism that separates our minds from the world and the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues that our experience has conceptual content. Before reading the book, it sounds plausible to me that we conceptualize non-conceptual content of our experience. However, McDowell points out that it is the idea which brings the osicillation since non-conceptual content cannot justify our beliefs. As long as we admit that our experience plays an important role in adjusting our minds and thus involves the faculty of spontaneity, we reach the conclusion that our experience is conceptual.
Here is my sketch to express McDowell's idea:

The most mystifying notion in this book must be that of <b>second nature</b>. McDowell denies the modern conception of nature in terms of the realm of law, and he expands the notion so that human nature can even cover the space of reasons. This is a novel trial and it is difficult to evaluate its plausibility. Certainly, it is hard to deny that spontaneity is included in human nature and that human beings are a kind of animal. Nevertheless, the modern conception of nature is so familiar with us that we get reluctant to take Aristotelian notion of second nature.
